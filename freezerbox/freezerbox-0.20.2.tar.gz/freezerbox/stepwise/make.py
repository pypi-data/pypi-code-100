class Make(appcli.App):
    """\
Display a protocol for making the given reagents.

Usage:
    make <tags>... [-R] [-x <tags>]

Arguments:
    <tags>
        The names of any number of reagents in the FreezerBox database, e.g. 
        p01 or f01.  By default, any other reagents that are needed to make the 
        named reagents and that are marked as "not ready" (e.g. "n", "no", "0" 
        in the "Ready" column) will also be included in the resulting protocol.

Options:
    -R --no-recurse
        Only make the reagents specified on the command line; don't 
        automatically include dependencies that are marked as "not ready" in 
        the database.

    -x --exclude <tags>
        A comma-separated list of tags to exclude from the protocol, i.e. 
        dependencies that would normally be included in the protocol but should 
        be excluded for some idiosyncratic reason.

Protocols are derived from the "Synthesis" and "Cleanups" columns of the 
FreezerBox database.  There is an important distinction between these two 
columns.  The "Synthesis" column is for protocols that actually create new 
reagents.  This most often means creating new sequences.  Examples of such 
protocols include PCR, Gibson or Golden Gate assemblies, restriction digests, 
etc.  In contrast, the "Cleanups" column is for protocols that don't create new 
reagents.  These often relate to things like purification or storage.  Examples 
include minipreps, gel purifications, aliquoting, etc.

Each reagent can only have one synthesis protocol, but can have any number of 
cleanup protocols.  This limit on synthesis protocols ensures that every 
reagent has its own name and can be easily and unambiguously referred to in 
other protocols.

Both columns have the same basic syntax for specifying protocol parameters 
(shown below).  For the "Cleanups" column, multiple protocols can be specified 
by separating several of these specifications with semi-colons (;).

    <protocol> [<value>]... [<key>=<value>]...

The following protocols are currently installed:

<%!
from freezerbox.model import MAKER_PLUGINS
from textwrap import indent
%>\
${indent('\\n'.join(MAKER_PLUGINS), '    ')}

Except for `sw` and `order`, each of these should correspond to a stepwise 
protocol of the same (or similar) name.  Information about the parameters 
expected by each protocol can obtained by running that protocol with the `-h` 
flag, e.g. `sw pcr -h`.  Look for a section in the resulting help text labeled 
"Database".  If you are unsure of a specific protocol's name, it may be helpful 
to get a list of every installed protocol (not all of which can be used in the 
FreezerBox database) by running `sw list`.

`sw` and `order` are built-in protocols available only in FreezerBox.  They do 
not correspond to any stepwise commands, but are documented below:

`sw`
    Create reagents using arbitrary stepwise commands.

        sw <command>... [deps=<tags>] [cwd=<path>] [expt=<id>] [project=<path>] 
            [seq=<seq>] [conc=<conc>] [volume=<vol>] [molecule=<type>]

    <command>
        The arguments to pass to stepwise.  Note that this may need to be 
        quoted if characters such as equals (=), semi-colon (;), backslash (\\), 
        or quotes themselves ('") appear in the command.

    deps=<tags>
        The tags (e.g. p1, f1) of any reagents that must be synthesized before 
        the reagent in question.  If not specified, you may get protocols with 
        steps out of order.

    cwd=<path>
        The directory that should be moved to before executing the protocol 
        command.  If not specified, the command will be executed in the current 
        working directory.  This is useful for commands that are not installed 
        globally.

    expt=<id>
        The id number of an Ex Memo experiment.  If specified, the protocol 
        command will be executed from the directory corresponding to that 
        experiment.  This is basically a more succinct way to specify `cwd`, in 
        the event that you use Ex Memo.

    project=<path>
        The path to the root directory of an Ex Memo project.  This is used in 
        conjunction with the `expt` option described above.  If not specified, 
        the project encompassing the current working directory will be used.

    seq=<seq>
        The sequence of the reagent (if applicable).  This can also be 
        specified in the "Sequence" column.

    conc=<conc>
        The concentration of the reagent (if applicable), including a unit.  
        This can also be specified in the "Sequence" column.

    volume=<vol>
        The concentration of the reagent (if applicable), including a unit.  
        This can also be specified in the "Sequence" column.

    molecule=<molecule>
        What kind of nucleic acid the reagent is (if applicable), e.g. DNA, 
        RNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, etc.

    Unlike protocols with devoted plugins, protocols specified in this way 
    can't be smartly merged into succinct master mixes, because FreezerBox 
    doesn't really understand anything about them.  However, it's still useful 
    to be able to specify arbitrary commands for one-off reagents.  If you find 
    yourself using this protocol a lot, you might want to think about writing a 
    protocol plugin.  

    Note that you cannot pipe commands with this protocol.  If you need one or 
    more pipes, put your commands in a shell script and reference that script 
    from the database.

`order`
    Indicate that a reagent was ordered from a vendor.

        order vendor=<name> [seq=<seq>] [conc=<conc>] [volume=<vol>] 
            [molecule=<type>]

    vendor=<name>
        The name of the company the reagent was ordered from.

    seq=<seq>
        The sequence of the reagent (if applicable).  This can also be 
        specified in the "Sequence" column.

    conc=<conc>
        The concentration of the reagent (if applicable), including a unit.  
        This can also be specified in the "Sequence" column.

    volume=<vol>
        The concentration of the reagent (if applicable), including a unit.  
        This can also be specified in the "Sequence" column.

    molecule=<molecule>
        What kind of nucleic acid the reagent is (if applicable), e.g. DNA, 
        RNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, etc.
