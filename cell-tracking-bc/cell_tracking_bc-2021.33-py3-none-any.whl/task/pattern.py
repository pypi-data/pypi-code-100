"""
This module was adapted from the module defining the function ``match_template`` of Scikit-Image.
Function documentation:
https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html?highlight=match#skimage.feature.match_template
Module Code:
https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/skimage/feature/template.py
The original function ``match_template`` was adapted to the 1-D case, and the parameter ``normalized`` was added. To
understand its purpose, let us remind that the Pearson correlation coefficient involves a normalization by the product
of the standard deviations. See for example:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient
This normalization may be undesirable in the presence of noise in the signal. For that reason, the parameter
``normalized`` can take the following values:
    - None: no normalization is performed; the correlation is the local covariance; this is an unbounded version of
    "max";
    - "max": the template response is normalized by the maximum (local) response; this limits the effect of noise;
    - "stddev": corresponds to the original normalization, so that the response is the (local) Pearson correlation
    coefficient.
