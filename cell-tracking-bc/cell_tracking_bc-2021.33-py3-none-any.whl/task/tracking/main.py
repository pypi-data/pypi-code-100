    counterparts. The default implementation already move next_cells to cells. New contexts are in charge of moving the
    other attributes after calling super().Advance(). Similarly, the method DiscoverNextCells temporarily stores the
    discovered cells in next_cells, and new contexts are in charge of computing and storing the others attributes after
