It\'s\nideal for collectively managing groups of resources throughout their\nlifecycle. Resource definitions can be created and managed entirely in Python\ncode (the pure-Python approach), but kuber is most effective when used in a\nhybrid fashion that combines configuration files and Python code.\nkuber also integrates and maintains compatibility with the lower-level official\n[Kubernetes Python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python),\nwhile abstracting basic CRUD operations into higher level constructs\nmore inline with the behaviors of tools like *kubectl* and *helm*.\n\n## Key Functionality\n\nHere are some key things that kuber does well:\n\n- A flexible workflow for managing Kubernetes resource configuration in Python\n  code.\n- The ability to load resources directly from YAML or JSON configuration files,\n  modify them in code and then use them or save them back to YAML/JSON files.\n- Resource bundling for managing groups of resource configurations collectively.\n- CRUD operations exposed directly on the resource objects to reduce the\n  overhead in managing low-level clients.\n- Convenience functions that simplify common operations, e.g. managing\n  containers within pods from the root resource.\n- Very thorough type-hinting and object structure to support creating accurate\n  resource configurations and catch errors before runtime.\n- All resources and sub-resources support used in `with` blocks as context\n  managers to simplify making multiple changes to a sub-resource.\n- Simultaneous support for multiple Kubernetes API versions. Manage multiple\n  Kubernetes API versions (e.g. while promoting new versions from development\n  to production) without having to pin and switch Python environments.\n\n## Installation\n\nkuber available for installation with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):\n\n```bash\n$ pip install kuber\n```\n \n## Quickstart\n\nkuber can be used to manage individual resources or a group of resources\ncollectively. kuber is also very flexible about how resources are created - \neither directly from Python or by loading and parsing YAML/JSON configuration\nfiles. The first example shows the multi-resource management path:\n\n```python\nimport kuber\nfrom kuber.latest import apps_v1\n\n# Create a bundle and load all resource definitions from the\n# `app_configs` directory as well as the `app-secret.yaml`\n# configuration file from the local `secrets` directory.\nresource_bundle = (\n    kuber.create_bundle()\n    .add_directory("app_configs")\n    .add_file("secrets/app-secret.yaml")\n)\n\n# Modify the metadata labels on all resources in the bundle.\nfor resource in resource_bundle.resources:\n    resource.metadata.labels.update(environment="production")\n\n# Update the replica count of the loaded deployment named\n# "my-app" to the desired initial count.\nd: apps_v1.Deployment = resource_bundle.get(\n    name="my-app",\n    kind="Deployment"\n)\nd.spec.replicas = 20\n\n# Load the current `kubeconfig` cluster configuration into\n# kuber for interaction with the cluster.\nkuber.load_access_config()\n\n# Turn this bundle script into a file that can be called from\n# the command line to carry out CRUD operations on all the\n# resources contained within it collectively. For example,\n# to create the resources in this bundle, call this script\n# file with a create argument.\nresource_bundle.cli()\n```\n\nOr managing resources individually:\n\n```python\nfrom kuber.latest import batch_v1\n\njob = batch_v1.Job()\n\n# Populate metadata using context manager syntax for brevity.\nwith job.metadata as md:\n    md.name = "my-job"\n    md.namespace = "jobs"\n    md.labels.update(\n        component="backend-tasks",\n        environment="production"\n    )\n\n# Add a container to the job spec.\njob.spec.append_container(\n    name="main",\n    image="my-registry.com/projects/my-job:1.0.1",\n    image_pull_policy="Always",\n    env=[batch_v1.EnvVar("ENVIRONMENT", "production")]\n)\n\n# Print the resulting YAML configuration for display. This\n# could also be saved somewhere to use later as the\n# configuration file to deploy to the cluster in cases\n# like a multi-stage CI pipeline.\nprint(job.to_yaml())\n```\n\nCheck out the [kuber documentation](https://kuber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nfor more details and examples.\n',
