Please familarize yourself with it and then\nrun:\n\n`$ poetry install`\n\n# Usage\n\n`dfa_identify` is centered around the `find_dfa` and `find_dfas` function. Both take in\nsequences of accepting and rejecting "words", where are word is a\nsequence of arbitrary python objects. \n\n1. `find_dfas` returns all minimally sized (no `DFA`s exist of size\nsmaller) consistent with the given labeled data.\n\n2. `find_dfa` returns an arbitrary (first) minimally sized `DFA`.\n\nThe returned `DFA` object is from the [dfa](https://github.com/mvcisback/dfa) library.\n\n\n```python\nfrom dfa_identify import find_dfa\n\n\naccepting = [\'a\', \'abaa\', \'bb\']\nrejecting = [\'abb\', \'b\']\n    \nmy_dfa = find_dfa(accepting=accepting, rejecting=rejecting)\n\nassert all(my_dfa.label(x) for x in accepting)\nassert all(not my_dfa.label(x) for x in rejecting)\n```\n\nBecause words are sequences of arbitrary python objects, the\nidentification problem, with `a` ↦ 0 and `b` ↦ 1, is given below:\n\n\n```python\naccepting = [[0], [0, \'z\', 0, 0], [\'z\', \'z\']]\nrejecting = [[0, \'z\', \'z\'], [\'z\']]\n\nmy_dfa = find_dfa(accepting=accepting, rejecting=rejecting)\n```\n\n# Minimality\n\nThere are two forms of "minimality" supported by `dfa-identify`.\n\n1. By default, dfa-identify returns DFAs that have the minimum\n   number of states required to seperate the accepting and\n   rejecting set.\n2. If the `order_by_stutter` flag is set to `True`, then the\n   `find_dfas` (lazily) orders the DFAs so that the number of\n   self loops (stuttering transitions) appearing the DFAs decreases.\n   `find_dfa` thus returns a DFA with the most number of self loops\n   given the minimal number of states.\n\n# Encoding\n\nThis library currently uses the encodings outlined in [Heule, Marijn JH, and Sicco Verwer. "Exact DFA identification using SAT solvers." International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2010.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15488-1_7) and [Ulyantsev, Vladimir, Ilya Zakirzyanov, and Anatoly Shalyto. "Symmetry Breaking Predicates for SAT-based DFA Identification."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05028).\n\nThe key difference is in the use of the symmetry breaking clauses. Two kinds are exposed.\n\n1. clique (Heule 2010): Partially breaks symmetries by analyzing\n   conflict graph.\n2. bfs (Ulyantsev 2016): Breaks all symmetries so that each model corresponds to a unique DFA.\n\n# Goals and related libraries\n\nThere are many other python libraries that \nperform DFA and other automata inference.\n\n1. [DFA-Inductor-py](https://github.com/ctlab/DFA-Inductor-py) - State of the art passive inference via reduction to SAT (as of 2019).\n2. [z3gi](https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/rick/z3gi): Uses SMT backed passive learning algorithm.\n3. [lstar](https://pypi.org/project/lstar/): Active learning algorithm based L* derivative.\n\nThe primary goal of this library is to loosely track the state of the art in passive SAT based inference while providing a simple implementation and API.\n',
